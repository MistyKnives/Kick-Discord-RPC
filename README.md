# Getting Started
1. Open the KickRPC.bat file, this will check if you have Java 19 installed and will provide a link if you don't.

2. If it is your first time launching the program, these two popups will display
   * Enter your Kick username for this one

   * This decides whether you want a timer displayed on your RPC displaying your stream time (From when the program detects your stream)
   * 0 = Do not display time
   * 1 = Display time
